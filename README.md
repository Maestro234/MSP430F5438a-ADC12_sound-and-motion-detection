# MSP430F5438a-ADC12_sound-and-motion-detection
MSP430 ADC12 tutorial with Uart communication
messages are sent to the console (PUTTY) when there is either motion or sound detected
sound detection threshold is set at 3000, which is crappy but works, anything less than would trigger the interrupt every second
